## Project Goals
This project provides a Django Rest Framework API for the [Productivity App Project](https://github.com/yohannes2025/pp5_productivity_app_frontend).

The **Productivity App** project focuses on developing a **calendar-driven application** designed to help users organize their time efficiently. This **browser-based platform** allows users to create and manage **tasks and habits** effectively.
This application is built to ensure a **seamless user experience** in maintaining daily productivity through a clean, intuitive interface and smart task organization tools.

## Planning
Planning started by creating epics and user stories for the frontend application, based on the project goals. The user stories were used to inform wireframes mapping out the intended functionality and 'flow' through the app. See the [repo for the frontend React app](https://github.com/yohannes2025/pp5_productivity_app_frontend) for more details.

The user stories requiring implementation to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP) were then mapped to API endpoints required to support the desired functionality.

## Data Models
### Category Model

* Represents a category for tasks.
* **Fields:**
    * `name`: `CharField(max_length=100)` - The name of the category (e.g., "Work", "Personal").
* **`__str__` method:** Returns the name of the category, making it human-readable in the Django admin and other contexts.

### Priority Model

* Represents the priority level of a task.
* **Fields:**
    * `name`: `CharField(max_length=50)` - The name of the priority level (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low").
    * `level`: `IntegerField(help_text="Lower number = higher priority")` - An integer representing the priority level. A lower number indicates a higher priority.
* **`__str__` method:** Returns a string combining the priority name and its level (e.g., "High (1)").

### TaskStatus Model

* Represents the status of a task.
* **Fields:**
    * `name`: `CharField(max_length=50)` - The name of the task status (e.g., "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed").
* **`__str__` method:** Returns the name of the task status.

### Task Model

* Represents a single task in the application.
* **Fields:**
    * `title`: `CharField(max_length=200)` - The title of the task.
    * `description`: `TextField(blank=True, null=True)` - A more detailed description of the task. Allows for empty or null values.
    * `due_date`: `DateField()` - The date when the task is due.
    * `created_at`: `DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)` - Automatically set to the current time when the task is created.
    * `updated_at`: `DateTimeField(auto_now=True)` - Automatically updated to the current time whenever the task is saved.
    * `category`: `ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)` - A foreign key relationship to the `Category` model. If a category is deleted, the `category` field of associated tasks will be set to `NULL`. Allows for tasks without a category.
    * `priority`: `CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('low', 'Low'), ('medium', 'Medium'), ('high', 'High')])` - The priority of the task, chosen from predefined options.
    * `status`: `CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('pending', 'Pending'), ('in progress', 'In Progress'), ('completed', 'Completed')])` - The current status of the task, chosen from predefined options.
    * `assigned_users`: `ManyToManyField(User, related_name='assigned_tasks')` - A many-to-many relationship with the built-in `User` model. Allows multiple users to be assigned to a single task, and a user can be assigned to multiple tasks. The `related_name` allows accessing tasks assigned to a user via `user.assigned_tasks`.
    * `owner`: `ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)` - A foreign key relationship to the user who created the task. Uses the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting for flexibility. If the owner user is deleted, all their tasks will be deleted (`on_delete=models.CASCADE`). Allows for tasks without an explicit owner (though this might need consideration based on application logic).
    * `file`: `FileField(upload_to='attachments/', blank=True, null=True)` - Allows uploading a file attachment to the task. Files will be stored in the `attachments/` directory within the media root. Allows for no file to be uploaded.
* **`__str__` method:** Returns the title of the task.

### UserProfile Model

* Represents additional profile information for users. Note that this is a separate model from the built-in `User` model.
* **Fields:**
    * `name`: `CharField(max_length=100)` - The name of the user profile.
    * `avatar`: `ImageField(upload_to='avatars/', null=True, blank=True)` - Allows uploading an avatar image for the user. Images will be stored in the `avatars/` directory within the media root. Allows for no avatar to be uploaded.
* **`__str__` method:** Returns the name associated with the user profile.

### Settings Model

* Represents user-specific settings.
* **Fields:**
    * `user`: `OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=1)` - A one-to-one relationship with the built-in `User` model. Each user will have exactly one settings object. If the associated user is deleted, their settings will also be deleted. The `default=1` might need to be reviewed as it assumes a default user with ID 1 exists. It's generally better to handle initial settings creation differently (e.g., via signals).
    * `theme`: `CharField(max_length=50, default='light')` - The user's preferred theme. Defaults to 'light'.
    * `notifications_enabled`: `BooleanField(default=True)` - Indicates whether notifications are enabled for the user. Defaults to `True`.
* **`__str__` method:** Returns the username of the associated user.

## Frameworks, libraries and dependencies
The Productivity API is implemented in Python using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [Django Rest Framework](https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The following additional utilities, apps and modules were also used.

### django-cloudinary-storage
https://pypi.org/project/django-cloudinary-storage/

Enables cloudinary integration for storing user profile images in cloudinary.

### dj-allauth
https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Used for user authentication. this package enables registration and authentication using a range of social media accounts.

### dj-rest-auth
https://dj-rest-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html

Provides REST API endpoints for login and logout. 

### djangorestframework-simplejwt
https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Provides JSON web token authentication.

### dj-database-url
https://pypi.org/project/dj-database-url/

Creates an environment variable to configure the connection to the database.

### psychopg2
https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/

Database adapater to enable interaction between Python and the PostgreSQL database.

### python-dateutil
https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/

This module provides extensions to the standard Python datetime module. It is a pre-requisite for django-recurrence library.

### django-recurrence
https://django-recurrence.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This utility enables functionality for working with recurring dates in Django. It provides a `ReccurenceField` field type for storing recurring datetimes in the database.

### django-filter
https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

django-filter is used to implement ISO datetime filtering functionality for the `events` GET endpoint. The client is able to request dates within a range using the `from_date` and `to_date` URL parameters. The API performs an additional check after filtering to 'catch' any repeat events within the requested range, where the original event stored in the database occurred beforehand.

### django-cors-headers
https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/

This Django app adds Cross-Origin-Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to responses, to enable the API to respond to requests from origins other than its own host.
Productivity App is configured to allow requests from all origins, to facilitate future development of a native mobile app using this API.
